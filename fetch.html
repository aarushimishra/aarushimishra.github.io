                    Data generation is a distinctive mark of our age. If you are a knowledge worker, you may be dealing with this frustration daily. Windows of infinite tabs; folders accumulating a million “Untitled-01” files. This is because humans aren’t equipped to hanlie this much data. The sad part is, our operating systems/desktops haven’t evolved to hanlie such data either.

                <p>
                    In 1973, Xerox Parc introduced to the world Xerox Alto. The first personal computer to use a mouse and the desktop metaphor. This was created to suit a very different need than that we face today. The world has evolved since then and the way we create and consume information has radicalised. But still we use a system that was designed 40 years back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People today have different needs to store, re-find and re-use information, yet these tasks are neither understood nor supported by the existing tools and softwares. A person’s data is no longer confined to a local hard-drive, it is scattered all over, from cloud storage to emails, from disk-drives to social media, and successfully managing this data is beyond human capabilities. The current file management systems fail to recognise this and offer their users with solutions that are incoherent, technical and meaningless. Yes, these elaborate file systems allow people to keep themselves organised  but the rigidity of the linear file system actually conceals the a huge amount of the content.The challenge today for the human centred computer systems is not to deliver more information <i>“to anyone, at anytime, and from anywhere,”</i> but to provide their users with <b>“the ‘right’ information, at the ‘right’ time, in the ‘right’ place, in the ‘right’ way, to the ‘right’ person.” </b>
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">Research</h3>
                <p>
                    The research for this project was particularly a difficult one for me, as I was not sure what I was looking for. I started with a web search of file management systems like ‘finder’ and ‘windows explorer' and their alternative solutions like ‘pathfinder’ and ‘xplorer 2’. After studying these tools briefly, I came to a conclusion that they are not a solution but, mere band-aids to an already broken system. A few frustrating days later, I started to look into ‘how does the human-brain function’. How does it store information, maintains it, archives it, and retrieves it. What more ‘humane’ than the natural way of perceiving things?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The human memory retrieval process works based on <b>‘association’</b>. When the brain tries to retrieve information from the long-term memory it involves following a <b>‘pathway’</b> of associations. The psychological term for this process is referred to as <b>‘priming’</b>. In priming, one idea reminds of another idea—that is, one idea activates another. The second idea reminds of a third idea, and so on. If the pathway of associations eventually leads a person to what he/she are trying to remember, they indeed remember it. The accuracy of remembering what has been previously learnt, greatly depends upon the following principles:

                        How easily something is recalled depends on how it was initially learned.

                    <li>
                        Remembering depends on the context.

                    <li>
                        How easily something is recalled and used depends on how often it has been recalled and used in the past. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recall often involves reconstruction.

                Post the primary research, I conducted user interviews to recognise the experiences, challenges, pain-points, and needs of the real-time users. My questions were focused towards understanding three key objectives:

                <li>
                    Do they invest in any software for content-management or information retrieval? If so, what were the advantages and limitations?

                    It is easier to recognise content, rather than recollecting it.
                </b></p>
                <p>   
                    When the interview participants were asked to re-find the files as a task, it was observed that they preferred folder-based navigation as opposed to search. They chose a time- mourned method of returning to files through a series of steps: navigate through the folder hierarchy to the folder where the file is thought to be and then scan the folder contents to recognise the sought for file. This method was adopted by the participant because they felt that the visual preview (recognition) of a file gave them a better idea of what file would it be as opposed to recall/recollection of the file name. 
                    <br>
                    It has been proved in various researches that <b>Recognition and recollection are both part of the human memory, but recognition triumphs over recollection when it comes to retrieving information.</b>

                    Saving a file is a problem.
                </b></p>
                <p>   
                    In the current scenario, it was observed that some people aimlessly save files. These files are saved either by a name which cannot be recalled later or as ‘untitled’. The current file manager systems do offer various methods such as hierarchal structures, tagging etc. to manage the files better, but, unfortunately it is all manual. Hence, the process of saving a file is very ambiguous. 
                    <br>
                    While interviewing the participants it was observed that, some were obliged to save their files in an organised fashion whereas the others failed in the process.

                <p>   
                    As discussed in the literature review, that desktop searches often fail to provide the users with the files they are looking for. The reason behind this is the user needs to remember the name or any other ‘technical’ attribute about the file to perform a successful search (Identity retrieval). 
                    <br>
                    The interview participants preferred folder-based navigation as a means to return to files. Search was the last-resort after other methods of return had failed.

                    With the increasing amount of data with the computer users it has become essential that files have appropriate meta-data for better search results. Unfortunately, the traditional file management software provide their users with irrelevant meta-data which is extremely technical and holds no meaning for the user. Mac OS does provide its users to tag their data, but it doesn’t work well because it has to be done manually.

                    After defining the user persona, I got a vague idea of who is the user and what are his needs. This helped me to create a few potential solution sketches.

                <h3 class="mt-6 mb-4">Proposed Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The proposed solution, ‘Fetch’ is a third-party, cloud based solution for intelligent file retrieval system on Mac OSX. In recognition to the shortcomings of the current file management systems, Fetch seeks to improve the way in which user’s data is saved, hence making its retrieval operation more humane in nature by leveraging the power of human memory.
                </p>
                <img src="./main/img/fetch/Solution.webp" class="img-fluid mb-4">
                <p>
                    Fetch organises the user’s data according to her location and provides the user with a unified view of her data relevant to that location. When the user creates any file it is automatically saved under a location. Other contextual markers such as people around, time (of creation, of modification etc.), file type, devices used to create the document are also saved along with the file. By tagging data with these contextual markers, the user is able to retrieve a file with ease as it correlates with her mental model of thinking.
