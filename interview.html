                                Users with families own multiple vehicles. They choose to travel individually for work but prefer using one vehicle when traveling otherwise. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                People living in metropolitan areas often opt for public transportation over their personal vehicles to reach their destinations. This saves them money and time for parking. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Constant search for free or affordable parking options as close to their destination as possible. They use Google maps to find parking spots and estimated walking distance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Notification bomb! One of the users who uses a parking app mentioned that it became a nuisance as there was no way to limit or control the amount of notifications while he was driving. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The uncertainty of where to park adds to the driver's anxiety. Especially when they are travelling to unfamiliar and unsafe areas. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Users were at times compelled to park further away from their destination because they were unaware of nearby parking spaces.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The local street rules and signs are extremely confusing. No standardisation existed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Non standardised parking meters make it stressful for older users to use.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Google’s Waze is an app used to find parking but it’s too cluttered with data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Since most of the apps rely on historical trends and not real-time data; the parking availability is often unpredictable. The foot-fall on weekends occupy most of the open streets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The refresh rate of parking apps is very slow.

                            <li>
                                Garages and lots often demand for cash and change. Digital payments often fail. Scan code doesn’t work on exit. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The time left on the parking meter is often calculated by the user. They use mobile phone alarms for this.
