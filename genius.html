                    Parking has become a problem for communities around the world. According to a report, more than 25% of drivers kill more than 15 minutes each day looking for a parking spot and over 80% say their problem is not knowing if there are free spots available or not.

                <p>
                    I did a brief market study that included going through the apps, their functionalities, and the data they capture. The primary research was a good starting point for developing insights and being aware of the market. This helped in improving the solution and addressing the latent need. The research was synthesised in a competitor analysis sheet to better understand the market I was about to enter.

                <p>
                    The key insights drawn from this study were -
                    <dl>
                        Parking space availability is predicted based on historical trends, instead of real-time data.
                    </dl>
                    <dl>
                        Overwhelming amount of information. This results in the screen getting cluttered with placards. Expecting the user to take an informed decision in this high pressure leads to driver stress.
                    </dl>
                    <dl>
                        The indexed results for a query aren’t always best for the user. For example, the parking availability may be the highest in a residential neighbourhood which might be 2 km away from the user’s destination.

                    This product is targeted towards the North American market, and being a person who has never traveled to that part of the world, I needed some micro and macro-level understanding of the subject. Aside from understanding the users, I also needed to understand the parking system and pain points which arise from a user perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talking to the users offered confirmation on many data points that were derived during the course of the primary research.

                <p>
                    I interviewed six drivers who helped me understand the subject as well as share their own experiences, challenges, pain-points, and needs. I created a rough guideline of open-ended questions related to the topic and conducted 1-to-1 interviews.

                    From my market research and user interviews, I used the findings to construct two provisional personas, Theodore and Josephine, to help me understand how our users can achieve their goals using the app.

The ideas created were organised into epics and stories. Below is an example of an epic of planning a trip.

                <p>
                    When some users saw the map for the first time, they instantly thought that the map was representing traffic in the city but not parking. While others got overwhelmed with the amount of information we were giving. The split up spots added to their confusion.

Green for open, Dark blue for meter and light blue for garages and lots. The disabled spots were marked orange to draw attention to them.

                    Earlier we used to display all the parking data that was available with us. This led the map to be over crowded and cluttered. It was one of the problems that were mentioned in our user research as well.

                <p><b>
                    We came up with the concept of a “parking score”. This was calculated based upon the availability of a parking spot + distance from the destination + price + historical data of occupancy. This helped us filter out the spots that might be relevant to the user. The user could see a maximum of 10 spots on the screen. If the user wished to view more spots around a location, they could zoom and view them.

                    Previously, when the user tapped on a street or a placard we directed them to the complete details page. This was a point of frustration for our users.

                <p><b>
                    The solution we created was to give basic information to the user when they tap on the card. If the user is interested in the details of that spot, they can simply slide to view these details. This interaction being a common one seemed as the best solution.

                    Street rules are confusing.
                </b></p>
                <p>
                    One of the recurring insights we received during our user research was that the street rules were confusing for many users.
                </p>
                <p><b>
                    We tried to address this by doing a small data visualisation exercise on our detailed information view to show when a particular street or garage is closed or free of charge or paid.

                    The data visualisation exercise provided a brief context to the users about the parking hours. But, it didn’t really solve the problem. The users still had to calculate the time remaining on their parking meter.

                    We decided to send them notification 1 hour before the time was about to expire. If the notifications were turned off we sent them an email and a SMS alert.

                    Over a period of time we received requests from our users that they would like to filter the data available on the map. For example: Viewing only open garages, finding disability parking spots etc.
                </p>
                <p><b>
                    This made us decide to introduce the filter feature. The data points were gathered over-time from our user feedback.

                    This was a really exciting and intensively researched project for me to work on. However, shifting priorities, changing requirements and reprioritization caused a lot of confusion and the scope of the project kept changing. I had to adapt to these changes and deliver the product within the given timelines.

                    Designing for a different location and culture is fiendishly difficult. At first, I assumed it would simply require me to translate British english to American English, using dollar instead of rupee; but is far more complex than that. I had to learn and design solutions that were colour blind friendly. Use the colour psychology that worked with the American audiences. Learn a completely different system of parking.
